## 🎾 About
Pong+ is a local multiplayer game (2 players) based on the 70s Pong game that was made for practicing the Javascript language.

This game was originally made to be a part of a minigames site developed as a project for the Web Script Languages subject at a System Analysis and Development graduation course.

If you want to see the site for which this game was built, here is the repository: [Minigame Mayhem](https://github.com/nadjielse/minigame-mayhem) (The version of the game that is on the site has some slight modifications, for example, there the game is single player against the computer).

## 👇 Accessing
The game is easily available on this link: [Pong+](https://nadjiel.github.io/pong-plus/).

## 🕹️ Controlling
The controls for this game are, for player 1 and player 2, respectively:

- <kbd>&#8593;</kbd> and <kbd>W</kbd>: Move up
- <kbd>&#8595;</kbd> and <kbd>S</kbd>: Move down
- <kbd>&#8592;</kbd> and <kbd>D</kbd>: Strong Strike

The Strong Strike is a small addition I put in this game that allows the players to send the ball faster to the oponent's side if they time well their strikes.
